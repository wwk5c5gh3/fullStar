"""Chat-id allow-list for the Telegram relay.

Restricts who can drive the bot — session-control commands type into the
operator's live terminal, so only authorized chats should reach the handlers.

Resolution: `TG_RELAY_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` (comma/semicolon-separated) is the
allow-list; if unset it falls back to the owner's `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. An empty
result means "not configured" → FAIL CLOSED (deny everyone). The relay refuses
to start with an empty allow-list, so the bot never accepts arbitrary chats.
There is intentionally no "allow all" escape hatch: this bot types into a live
terminal running an agent with bypassed permissions.
