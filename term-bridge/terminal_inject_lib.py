"""AppleScript builder for injecting text into Terminal.app via clipboard + Cmd-V.

Terminal.app has no silent write-into-running-program API (unlike iTerm), so we
put the text on the clipboard, bring the target window to the front, paste with
System Events (needs Accessibility), optionally press Return, then restore the
prior frontmost app and the previous clipboard. The text is read from a file
named by the TERM_INJECT_FILE env var to avoid AppleScript string escaping.
